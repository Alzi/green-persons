# green-persons

__This is work in progress.__

I like it to become a WordPress-Plugin for
managing person-information for websites of the german green party.

It is based on the WordPress-Theme [Joseph-knows-best](https://github.com/kre8tiv/Joseph-knows-best)

It will probably fit best with the WordPress-Theme [sunflower](https://github.com/codeispoetry/sunflower)
